= Camel Example with OpenAPI Contract

This example demonstrates how to apply Camel to expose REST APIs 
from the existing OpenAPI specification for Traccar (contract first).
This is a good starting point to integrate Camel channels 
with your administrativ software for full automation.

From the contract we generate Java POJO classes (using maven plugin, see `pom.xml`).

In the Camel route we use Rest DSL using OpenAPI in contract-first mode.
This makes it possible to expose all the APIs very easily, 
and map this to corresponding Camel
routes via `direct:operationId` naming convention.

This example has only implemented one of the Traccar APIs. 
This is handy, so you can implement each APIs as required by your program logic.
