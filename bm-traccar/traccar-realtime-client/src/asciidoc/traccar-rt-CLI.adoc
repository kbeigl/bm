= CLI Quick Start

After creating the three layers around the `ApiClient`, `Api interface` 
and `RealTimeManager` these are combined 
in the `@SpringBootApplication  RealTimeClient`.

== run `RealTimeClient` CLI

The `traccar-rt-client` does not provide any webservices.
It is a plain command line interface (CLI) to connect to a traccar server 
from the command line and read what's going on.

    @SpringBootApplication
    public class RealTimeClient implements CommandLineRunner

Therefor it is a solid building block for real time applications.
You can integrate it in your application and code against the
`RealTimeManager` as if it was the traccar server.


pick up the `traccar-rt-client-6.10.0-RC.jar`

put it in `/someFolder/traccar-rt-client-6.10.0-RC.jar`

(release url)

copy app.props

enter credentials

run java, mvn spring:run ..

start your traccar client or your tracker connected to traccar

watch the console over the map

If you don't have a traccar server you can sign up 
at one of traccar's demo servers.

RealTimeClient is a Spring Boot application that:

    •  Starts RealTimeController on launch.
    •  Reads admin credentials from application.properties.
    •  Logs in as the admin user when starting.
    •  Remains running until manually shutdown (e.g., Ctrl+C), and supports graceful shutdown.

  modify RealTimeClient to a @SpringBootApplication that starts the RealTimeController
  and log in as traccar.admin.name as provided in the application.properties and can be gracefully shutdown manually

  You can run the application as usual (e.g., with mvn spring-boot:run or java -jar),
  and it will log in and initialize the real-time controller using the configured admin credentials.
