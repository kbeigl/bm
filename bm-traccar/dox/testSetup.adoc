= Testing with Traccar Server

[toc]

The Traccar Client is _not_ a software with complex implementations of Java Units.
Actually it is merely an interface between REST and Java passing Entities. 
Therefor there is no need for cumbersom JUnit test setups
to test the technology we rely on.
The functionality is achieved by wiring diffent technology components
together, configure and run them.

For example the Camel `RestOpenApiComponent` 
is already being tested with each Camel build. These tests should not be repeated.

== surefire vs failsafe testing with docker

The aim of this project is to remote control a Traccar Server 
by reacting to live information. +
So we can take a broader approach to testing by setting up a Traccar Server for tests.
This makes the actual build of the Traccar Client software faster.
We use the Maven lifecycle to start a traccar docker container 
and apply failsafe to make sure the container is stoped after testing:

    [INFO] --- docker-maven-plugin:0.46.0:stop (stop) @ traccar-api-client ---
    [INFO] DOCKER> [traccar/traccar:6.7.1-ubuntu] "traccar": 
                    Stop and removed container 7ef24f3a8f58 after 0 ms

To speed up test development the traccar container can be started via command line 
and the Integration Tests (**IT*) can be run as JUnit Tests against a running server.
The developer can login to the Traccar Frontend to inspect test results and more.

The botton line is that emphasis is placed on integration testing 
using Mavenâ€™s Failsafe plugin in combination with Docker. 


== docker-maven-plugin

Requirements to docker are dead simple:
We need a traccar container out of the box, configure it to our needs, 
introspect the logs at runtime and finally using the traccar UI 
to visualize what's going on!

Since the project does not dockerize anything,
the plugin should not be to fancy about docker, kubernetes, cloud etc.
After setting up the project once, the focus is on using Spring Test framework 
and Camel's testing utilities to `mvn verify` integration logic and not unit-level.

There is no need to integrate Docker into the source code with
https://camel.apache.org/components/4.8.x/docker-component.html[Docker :: Apache Camel]
or the like, since this is not a docker project.
 
The choice is fabric8's `docker-maven-plugin` 
 
[quote,fabric8io/docker-maven-plugin] 
____
This is a Maven plugin for managing Docker images and containers. +
It focuses on two major aspects for a Docker build integration: +
Building Images and  Running Containers.

specifically for integration testing, focusing on lifecycle and reporting for integration tests.

Run Docker containers during the integration test phase to manage container lifecycle.

to execute tests within a Dockerized environment and ensure proper test lifecycle.
